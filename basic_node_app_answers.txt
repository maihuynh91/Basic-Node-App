Question 1: What is a Node module?
	Node module is a set of functions to include in our application. 

Question 2: What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
	Modules.exports is as a variable that gets returned from required().It an empty object by default and can be reassigned to anything.
	Exports likes a local variable object pointing to module.exports and exports is never returned (by required()). The reassignment of exports 
is not available outside of the module. All exports does is that it collects properties and attaches them to module.exports if module.exports does 
not have anything on it already. But if there's something on module.exports already, everything of exports is ignored.  

Question 3: Why is using exports recommended?
	Using exports as a shorthand to avoid the potential bugs, confusion, and save characters.
